**Smile or Suffer — BDSM Predicament Trainer**

Keep a smile... or get punished.

This script turns a webcam into a grin-detector and uses it to enforce a spicy predicament: smile = safe, stop smiling = stimulation. You set your session rules, connect your device, and the app handles the rest with timed bursts and randomized intensity inside your limits.

**Highlights**
- Smile-based predicament: fail the smile, take the sting
- On-screen options for session length, cooldowns, and intensity ranges
- Channel A/B support with randomized bursts
- Warm-up countdown and motivational prompts
- Live connection status and COM port selector
- Tested with **Estim System 2B**

**How it plays**
1. Configure your session in the Options window.
2. Select your COM port and connect.
3. Set your smile baseline.
4. Keep smiling to make the timer drain -- stop, and it fights back.
